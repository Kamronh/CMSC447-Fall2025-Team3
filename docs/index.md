Students are offered a rich liberal arts experience through honors classes, internships, study abroad, and other extracurricular opportunities. One of the hallmarks of the program is specialized attention. Each semester, students receive individual advising from Honors College staff who are also available for consultation throughout the year. Membership in the Honors College is intentionally kept small. With a total enrollment of approximately 500, the Honors College seeks to matriculate 100-150 students each year.</p><p>Students admitted to the Honors College undertake general honors study in honors versions of regular classes and specially commissioned honors seminars. Honors seminars, the subjects of which vary from semester to semester, cover a wide variety of interdisciplinary topics. Honors courses have limited enrollment and afford participants the opportunity for close interaction with distinguished members of the UMBC faculty. The Honors College encourages the development of advanced-level honors curricula and assists honors students in developing their programs, applying to graduate or professional schools, and gaining financial support for research and graduate study. Recent Honors College graduates have been accepted into programs at Princeton, Columbia, Yale, Stanford, University of Pennsylvania, Oxford, Cambridge, Duke, Harvard, NYU and Georgetown, among others. Students who complete the Honors College curriculum graduate with a Certificate of General Honors, which is noted on their transcript.</p><p>Students can apply to the Honors College as a part of their Transfer Application.

                    <input type="checkbox" id="IS vs. CMSC" class="clause-checkbox" value="<h3>How are Information Systems and Computer Science different?</h3><p><b>Computer Science</b> is the study of computers and computational systems. Unlike information systems, computer science deals mostly with software and software systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and application.</p><p>Principal areas of study within Computer Science include artificial intelligence, computer systems and networks, security, database systems, human computer interaction, vision and graphics, numerical analysis, programming languages, software engineering, bioinformatics and theory of computing.</p><p>Although knowing how to program is essential to the study of computer science, it is only one element of the field. Computer scientists design and analyze algorithms to solve programs and study the performance of computer hardware and software. The problems that computer scientists encounter range from the abstract-- determining what problems can be solved with computers and the complexity of the algorithms that solve them – to the tangible – designing applications that perform well on handheld devices, that are easy to use, and that uphold security measures.</p><p><b>Information Systems</b>, on the other hand, focuses on the entire system of information, knowledge, delivery and use, taking an external, human-based perspective on technology– its focus is on how technology can be implemented to serve the informational needs of people and organizations. This is why at UMBC we refer to Information Systems as the human side of computing. IS graduates from UMBC have opportunities to really make a difference—have an impact—on technologies that affect everyone from children to retirees.</p><p>IS graduates enter various industries with more than just the technical skills of programming, network applications and design, operating systems, telecommunications, database application and design, and web development and design. They also leave UMBC with a strong business and management background. In fact, many graduates have gone on to start their own successful thriving businesses. UMBC Information Systems students also develop excellent human communication skills that can be used to interact with a variety of audiences with various backgrounds. These skills are not only key career talents but excellent life skills.</p>
